  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>As a recent graduate from California State University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I have
    transitioned seamlessly into the world of datacenter operations at i3D.net. My academic journey, bolstered by an
    Associate of Science in Computer Network & Security Management, has equipped me with a robust foundation in hardware
    troubleshooting and network services.

    At i3D.net, our team supports global datacenter hardware, ensuring operational excellence through maintenance and
    complex problem-solving. My role includes collaborating with internal and external partners to deliver reliable and
    efficient solutions, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning and passion for technology infrastructure.

    I work part time as a Teacher and member of the Oversight Team at CodeFu in San Fernando Valley.

    In my free time, I create projects using Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, Ansible, Git, and many more tools.</p>
